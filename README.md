# Solved - The Mystery Walks App

<img height="70" src='./frontend/src/images/solved-logo-short.png'/>

This mobile app was created as final project by team of 5 junior software engineers at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/):

[David Scott](https://github.com/sirdavy),
[Juliana Nocchi](https://github.com/junocchi),
[Marta Bianchini](https://github.com/MartaBia),
[Michal Smyk](https://github.com/MichalSmyk),
[Orhan Khanbay](https://github.com/orhankhanbayov)

We didn't just stumble upon the idea for this app by accident. It all started with maps... but ended up being so much more !

## About the App

Solved is a live-action treasure hunting game that leads you on an exciting tour of a city neighbourhood. In each Solved treasure hunt you will use your knowledge of the city to search for five secret landmarks. During your adventure youâ€™ll win coins, get recommendations for local cafes and restaurants and learn some amazing facts!
      


## Getting started 

To run the app you will need:
- Node.js
- XCode Developer Tools (iOS simulator)
- Android Studio (android emulator)

### Node.js

ðŸ’» You will need Node.js on your machine. If you don't have it you can istall it using this command line in your terminal with brew for macOS.

```
$ brew install node
```
Or on Windows machine, go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and follow instructions 

The following guidance shows how to use NPM to setup and manage a JavaScript project and it's dependencies. 

If you don't have NVM ( Node Version Manager) on your machine [click here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install it.

```
# Setup your enviroment to use the latest version 

$ nvm use node

# Initialize the NPM project

$ npm init -y

# Add jest package 

$ npm add jest

# Install jest 'globally'

$npm install -g jest 

```

### XCode Developer Tools

ðŸ’» Install [XCode Developer Tools](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)


### Android Studio
ðŸ’» Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio#:~:text=Android%20Studio%20can%20be%20installed,in%20a%20few%20simple%20clicks.)

After Android Studio installation is completed, you will need to adjust the SDK settings:

Settings --> System Settings --> Android SDK --> go to the tab "DSK Platforms" and one at the time, click to download:

- Android SDK Build-Tools 34-rc1
- Android TiramisuPrivacySandbox Preview

Then, go to the tab "DSK Tools" and one at the time, click to download:

- Android SDK Build-Tools 34-rc1
- Android SDK Command-line Tools

Then, follow the instructions (steps 5 to 8), from [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)


### Google API
<!-- Orhan can you say that features have to be enabled in google API key  -->

First step to getting an API (or starting any project using google â€˜stuffâ€™) is setting up an account [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/discover?utm_source=Docs_GS_Button&ref=https:%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fmaps%2F&pli=1).

You need to enter a bank card even with a free-use plan.

Once signed up it creates a generic/default starter project and generates an API key. But you can select â€˜new projectâ€™ and it will give you another key specific to that one.

### TripAdvisor

To get TripAdvisor API key go to [developer page](https://www.tripadvisor.com/developers) and create you API key.

<!-- TODO -->
Upload your apis in .env file ( we need to say how they have to name them based on what we have in code base)

## Usage
<!-- mention any scripts -->
<!-- (is it a command line tool? Do you have to load it into IRB? Is it a web application? What port needs to be used?) -->



Navigate to api directory: 
```
$ cd api 

$ npm install
```
Then 

```
$ cd ../frontend

$ npm install
```

Then to run the server, in frontend directory :

```
$ npx expo start
```
Once expo server is running and you have Xcode and Android simulator installed press `i` for iOS simulator and `a` for Android simulator. 

You can also see the app on your iOS/Android phone. 
To do that you will need Expo Go app. After downloading the app on your phone you can scan QR code that will be displayed when you run ``` npx expo start ``` in your terminal


## Running tests

To run the tests, run this command line in main directory: 
```
$ jest
```
